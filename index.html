          <p class="item-text margin-bottom-20">
            Located on the southwest border of Nagpur in Maharashtra in India,
            the Ambazari Lake is one of the eleven lakes and largest one that
            the city of Nagpur houses. Boating facilities in rowboats, as well
            as self-driven paddleboats, are also available to the visitors,
            which add to the fun and excitement of visiting the lake and help
            them to explore the surrounding scenic beauty.
          </p>
          <p class="item-text margin-bottom-20">
            The Ambazari Lake is situated just 6 kilometres away from the
            western outskirts of Nagpur and is looked after and maintained by
            the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). It was initially built in
            the year 1870, under Bhonsle rule, for supplying water to the city.
            Just beside the Ambazari Lake, one can find the Ambazari Garden,
            which is particularly popular amongst the children and doubles up as
            an amusement park for them. The garden also has pavements walking, a
            fountain, electric rides and various amusement games for the kid. In
            fact, the lake derives its name Ambazari, because of this very fact
            that it is surrounded by mango trees. (The word Amba means mango in
            Marathi.) The Nag River also originates from here, and the site is
            indeed a marvel to look at!

            <strong> Recommendation:</strong> Also visit the garden beside
            Ambazari lake
