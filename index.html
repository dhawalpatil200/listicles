            When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while
            for me, but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated
            beverage at Bytes and I became reaquainted with the combination of
            fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so
            sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored carbonated
            water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them (or
            maybe they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it a nice
            coffee shop alternative for the times when you're feeling a
            refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.

          <p class="item-text margin-bottom-20">
            <strong> Recommendation:</strong> Raspberry Italian soda

            When your boba craving strikes, head over to Pop Tea Bar, a cute
            little bubble tea shop on Cambridge Avenue. The menu is your
            standard bubble tea fare with nothing too adventurous on the menu --
            no bubble tea floats, for example -- but the tapioca is fresh, the
            service is fast, and the tea is smooth and delicious! They have
            little bites to eat too, like popcorn chicken and eggrolls, in
            perfect snack-size portions. There's not too much seating, but
            there's a cute outdoor area in the back for warmer days.
          </p>
          <p class="item-text margin-bottom-20">
            Pop Tea Bar isn't exactly on campus, but the Marguerite has got you
            covered. Ride the 1050A to California and El Camino and it's a short
            walk from there. (11 minutes total from the Gates Computer Science
            Building!)

          <p class="item-text margin-bottom-20">
            <strong> Recommendation:</strong> Classic Milk Tea with tapioca + an
            order of popcorn chicken.

            I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla
            Bean Latte, only because CoHo is the only place I've ever ordered a
            Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not even totally sure I know what a
            Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I do know is the
            Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was delicious.
